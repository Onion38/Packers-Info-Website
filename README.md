# Packers-News-Webscraper
This website obtains headlines via websracping that report on the Green Bay Packers from ESPN and PackersWire and displays the data on one website. The website is run with the flask module from python. Basic css/html.


#### Note
This application was built a long time ago, so the webscraping does not work anymore. However if you would like to make a pull request and add more news sites, I'll merge it!
